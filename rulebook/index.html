        <h2 id="objectives"><a class="header-link" href="#objectives"></a>Objectives</h2>
        <p><strong>AMUROV</strong> is a national-level student competition established to
            generate, cultivate, and enhance a community of innovators capable of
            making substantive contributions to the Remotely Operated
            Underwater Vehicles (ROVs) domain.
        </p>
        <p>Participants tackle fundamental challenges in the design of ocean
            systems capable of changing the world — while getting hands-on
            experience by designing, building and testing a remotely operated
            underwater vehicle. By providing a venue and mechanism to share
            knowledge and innovate, students are primed for jobs in developing,
            testing and managing state-of-the-art systems.

        <p>
            The aim of the task is to check the maneuvering of the vehicle. The task is to move inside the maze arena on
            the surface of the pool, as shown in the fig.1.
        </p>
        <p>
            The vehicle has to move along the maze from the starting point and move towards the exit while following the
            path marked. The path is 100 cm wide. The ROV may swim without touching the boundaries of the maze and
            subsequently, points will be deducted for touching the boundary.

            ROV has to maneuver inside the maze, with a 100 cm gap between the outer and inner boundaries. The Maze is
            made 11up of Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) Pipes on the surface without any walls beneath.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Task2">Task 2 : Vision and Control</h3>
        <p>
            The goal of the challenge is to find and capture a target amid two balloons at the pool's bottom, each with
            a different color.
        </p>
        <p class="img-container"><img src="../images/rulebook/task2-tp.png" alt="flare"></p>
        <p class="image-caption"> Fig. 2.1 : Top View </p>
        <p>
            A target zone is established by two balloons with two different colors on each of the balloons, namely pink
            and orange, and two flags placed on the top section of the balloons. Fig. 2 depicts the position of the
            balloons in relation to the arena.

        <p class="image-caption"> Fig. 2.2 : Front View </p>
        <p>
            In the arena, there are two balloons. They're submerged in the target zone. On the top of both balloons,
            will be two flags. Each team is given a specific color representing a specific balloon. The ROV must begin
            at the starting position and then pass through the underwater gate, which is located around 5 m to 10 m from
            the starting point and has an inverted U form of height 1 m. When the ROV uses vision to locate the
            corresponding balloons with the specified color of blue and orange, points will be granted.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the ROV only wanders around the balloons with the prescribed color, it will receive some points; however, if the ROV touches the balloon with the respective/assigned color, it will receive additional points.
